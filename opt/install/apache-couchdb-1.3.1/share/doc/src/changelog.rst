Upgrade Notes
-------------

You can upgrade your existing CouchDB 1.0.x installation to 1.3.0
without any specific steps or migration. When you run CouchDB, the
existing data and index files will be opened and used as normal.

The first time you run a compaction routine on your database within 1.3.0,
the data structure and indexes will be updated to the new version of the
CouchDB database format that can only be read by CouchDB 1.3.0 and later.
This step is not reversible. Once the data files have been updated and
migrated to the new version the data files will no longer work with a
CouchDB 1.0.x release.

.. warning::
   If you want to retain support for opening the data files in
   CouchDB 1.0.x you must back up your data files before performing the
   upgrade and compaction process.

1.2.x Branch

Upgrade Notes
-------------

.. warning::

   This version drops support for the database format that was introduced in
   version 0.9.0. Compact your older databases (that have not been compacted
   for a long time) before upgrading, or they will become inaccessible.

Security changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The interface to the ``_users`` and ``_replicator`` databases have been
changed so that non-administrator users can see less information:

* In the ``_users`` database:

  * User documents can now only be read by the respective users, as well as
    administrators. Other users cannot read these documents.
  * Views can only be defined and queried by administrator users.
  * The ``_changes`` feed can only be queried by administrator users.

* In the ``_replicator`` database:

  * Documents now have a forced ``owner`` field that corresponds to the
    authenticated user that created them.
  * Non-owner users will not see confidential information like passwords or
    OAuth tokens in replication documents; they can still see the other
    contents of those documents. Administrators can see everything.
  * Views can only be defined and queried by administrators.

Database Compression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new optional (but enabled by default) compression of disk files requires
an upgrade of the on-disk format (5 -> 6) which occurs on creation for new
databases and views, and on compaction for existing files. This format is not
supported in previous releases, so rollback would require replication to the
previous CouchDB release or restoring from backup.

Compression can be disabled by setting ``compression = none`` in your
``local.ini`` ``[couchdb]`` section, but the on-disk format will still be
upgraded.

Version 1.2.0
-------------

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix use of OAuth with VHosts and URL rewriting.
* OAuth secrets can now be stored in the users system database
  as an alternative to key value pairs in the .ini configuration.
  By default this is disabled (secrets are stored in the .ini)
  but can be enabled via the .ini configuration key `use_users_db`
  in the `couch_httpd_oauth` section.
* Documents in the _users database are no longer publicly
  readable.
* Confidential information in the _replication database is no
  longer publicly readable.
* Password hashes are now calculated by CouchDB. Clients are no
  longer required to do this manually.
* Cookies used for authentication can be made persistent by enabling
  the .ini configuration key `allow_persistent_cookies` in the
  `couch_httpd_auth` section.

Build System
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* cURL is no longer required to build CouchDB as it is only
  used by the command line JS test runner. If cURL is available
  when building CouchJS you can enable the HTTP bindings by
  passing -H on the command line.
* Temporarily made `make check` pass with R15B. A more thorough
  fix is in the works (:issue:`1424`).
* Fixed --with-js-include and --with-js-lib options.
* Added --with-js-lib-name option.

Futon
^^^^^

* The `Status` screen (active tasks) now displays two new task status
  fields: `Started on` and `Updated on`.
* Futon remembers view code every time it is saved, allowing to save an
  edit that amounts to a revert.

HTTP Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added a native JSON parser.
* The _active_tasks API now offers more granular fields. Each
  task type is now able to expose different properties.
* Added built-in changes feed filter `_view`.
* Fixes to the `_changes` feed heartbeat option which caused
  heartbeats to be missed when used with a filter. This caused
  timeouts of continuous pull replications with a filter.
* Properly restart the SSL socket on configuration changes.

Replicator
^^^^^^^^^^

* A new replicator implementation. It offers more performance and
  configuration options.
* Passing non-string values to query_params is now a 400 bad
  request. This is to reduce the surprise that all parameters
  are converted to strings internally.
* Added optional field `since_seq` to replication objects/documents.
  It allows to bootstrap a replication from a specific source sequence
  number.
* Simpler replication cancellation. In addition to the current method,
  replications can now be canceled by specifying the replication ID
  instead of the original replication object/document.

Storage System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added optional database and view index file compression (using Google's
  snappy or zlib's deflate). This feature is enabled by default, but it
  can be disabled by adapting local.ini accordingly. The on-disk format
  is upgraded on compaction and new DB/view creation to support this.
* Several performance improvements, most notably regarding database writes
  and view indexing.
* Computation of the size of the latest MVCC snapshot data and all its
  supporting metadata, both for database and view index files. This
  information is exposed as the `data_size` attribute in the database and
  view group information URIs.
* The size of the buffers used for database and view compaction is now
  configurable.
* Added support for automatic database and view compaction. This feature
  is disabled by default, but it can be enabled via the .ini configuration.
* Performance improvements for the built-in changes feed filters `_doc_ids`
  and `_design`.

View Server
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/) as a first class view server
  language.
* Fixed old index file descriptor leaks after a view cleanup.
* The requested_path property keeps the pre-rewrite path even when no VHost
  configuration is matched.
* Fixed incorrect reduce query results when using pagination parameters.
* Made icu_driver work with Erlang R15B and later.

OAuth
^^^^^

* Updated bundled erlang_oauth library to the latest version.

Version 0.11.0
--------------

Build and System Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Updated and improved source documentation.
* Fixed distribution preparation for building on Mac OS X.
* Added support for building a Windows installer as part of 'make dist'.
* Bug fix for building couch.app's module list.
* ETap tests are now run during make distcheck. This included a number of
  updates to the build system to properly support VPATH builds.
* Gavin McDonald setup a build-bot instance. More info can be found at
  http://ci.apache.org/buildbot.html

Futon
^^^^^

* Added a button for view compaction.
* JSON strings are now displayed as-is in the document view, without the
  escaping of new-lines and quotes. That dramatically improves readability of
  multi-line strings.
* Same goes for editing of JSON string values. When a change to a field value is
  submitted, and the value is not valid JSON it is assumed to be a string. This
  improves editing of multi-line strings a lot.
* Hitting tab in textareas no longer moves focus to the next form field, but
  simply inserts a tab character at the current caret position.
* Fixed some font declarations.

HTTP Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Provide Content-MD5 header support for attachments.
* Added URL Rewriter handler.
* Added virtual host handling.

Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Statistics are now calculated for a moving window instead of non-overlapping
  timeframes.
* Fixed a problem with statistics timers and system sleep.
* Moved statistic names to a term file in the priv directory.

Security
^^^^^^^^

* Fixed CVE-2010-0009: Apache CouchDB Timing Attack Vulnerability.
* Added default cookie-authentication and users database.
* Added Futon user interface for user signup and login.
* Added per-database reader access control lists.
* Added per-database security object for configuration data in validation
  functions.
* Added proxy authentication handler

Storage System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Adds batching of multiple updating requests, to improve throughput with many
  writers. Removed the now redundant couch_batch_save module.
* Adds configurable compression of attachments.

View Server
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added optional 'raw' binary collation for faster view builds where Unicode
  collation is not important.
* Improved view index build time by reducing ICU collation callouts.
* Improved view information objects.
* Bug fix for partial updates during view builds.
* Move query server to a design-doc based protocol.
* Use json2.js for JSON serialization for compatiblity with native JSON.
* Major refactoring of couchjs to lay the groundwork for disabling cURL
  support. The new HTTP interaction acts like a synchronous XHR. Example usage
  of the new system is in the JavaScript CLI test runner.

0.8.x Branch
============

.. contents::
   :depth: 1
   :local:

Version 0.8.1-incubating
------------------------

Build and System Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The `couchdb` script no longer uses `awk` for configuration checks as this
  was causing portability problems.
* Updated `sudo` example in `README` to use the `-i` option, this fixes
  problems when invoking from a directory the `couchdb` user cannot access.

Database Core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix for replication problems where the write queues can get backed up if the
  writes aren't happening fast enough to keep up with the reads. For a large
  replication, this can exhaust memory and crash, or slow down the machine
  dramatically. The fix keeps only one document in the write queue at a time.
* Fix for databases sometimes incorrectly reporting that they contain 0
  documents after compaction.
* CouchDB now uses ibrowse instead of inets for its internal HTTP client
  implementation. This means better replication stability.

Futon
^^^^^

* The view selector dropdown should now work in Opera and Internet Explorer
  even when it includes optgroups for design documents. (:issue:`81`)

JavaScript View Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Sealing of documents has been disabled due to an incompatibility with
  SpiderMonkey 1.9.
* Improve error handling for undefined values emitted by map functions.
  (:issue:`83`)

HTTP Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix for chunked responses where chunks were always being split into multiple
  TCP packets, which caused problems with the test suite under Safari, and in
  some other cases.
* Fix for an invalid JSON response body being returned for some kinds of
  views. (:issue:`84`)
* Fix for connections not getting closed after rejecting a chunked request.
  (:issue:`55`)
* CouchDB can now be bound to IPv6 addresses.
* The HTTP `Server` header now contains the versions of CouchDB and Erlang.


Version 0.8.0-incubating
------------------------

Build and System Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* CouchDB can automatically respawn following a server crash.
* Database server no longer refuses to start with a stale PID file.
* System logrotate configuration provided.
* Improved handling of ICU shared libraries.
* The `couchdb` script now automatically enables SMP support in Erlang.
* The `couchdb` and `couchjs` scripts have been improved for portability.
* The build and system integration have been improved for portability.

Database Core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The view engine has been completely decoupled from the storage engine. Index
  data is now stored in separate files, and the format of the main database
  file has changed.
* Databases can now be compacted to reclaim space used for deleted documents
  and old document revisions.
* Support for incremental map/reduce views has been added.
* To support map/reduce, the structure of design documents has changed. View
  values are now JSON objects containing at least a `map` member, and
  optionally a `reduce` member.
* View servers are now identified by name (for example `javascript`) instead of
  by media type.
* Automatically generated document IDs are now based on proper UUID generation
  using the crypto module.
* The field `content-type` in the JSON representation of attachments has been
  renamed to `content_type` (underscore).

Futon
^^^^^

* When adding a field to a document, Futon now just adds a field with an
  autogenerated name instead of prompting for the name with a dialog. The name
  is automatically put into edit mode so that it can be changed immediately.
* Fields are now sorted alphabetically by name when a document is displayed.
* Futon can be used to create and update permanent views.
* The maximum number of rows to display per page on the database page can now
  be adjusted.
* Futon now uses the XMLHTTPRequest API asynchronously to communicate with the
  CouchDB HTTP server, so that most operations no longer block the browser.
* View results sorting can now be switched between ascending and descending by
  clicking on the `Key` column header.
* Fixed a bug where documents that contained a `@` character could not be
  viewed. (:issue:`12`)
* The database page now provides a `Compact` button to trigger database
  compaction. (:issue:`38`)
* Fixed portential double encoding of document IDs and other URI segments in
  many instances. (:issue:`39`)
* Improved display of attachments.
* The JavaScript Shell has been removed due to unresolved licensing issues.

JavaScript View Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* SpiderMonkey is no longer included with CouchDB, but rather treated as a
  normal external dependency. A simple C program (`_couchjs`) is provided that
  links against an existing SpiderMonkey installation and uses the interpreter
  embedding API.
* View functions using the default JavaScript view server can now do logging
  using the global `log(message)` function. Log messages are directed into the
  CouchDB log at `INFO` level. (:issue:`59`)
* The global `map(key, value)` function made available to view code has been
  renamed to `emit(key, value)`.
* Fixed handling of exceptions raised by view functions.

HTTP Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* CouchDB now uses MochiWeb instead of inets for the HTTP server
  implementation. Among other things, this means that the extra configuration
  files needed for inets (such as `couch_httpd.conf`) are no longer used.
* The HTTP interface now completely supports the `HEAD` method. (:issue:`3`)
* Improved compliance of `Etag` handling with the HTTP specification.
  (:issue:`13`)
* Etags are no longer included in responses to document `GET` requests that
  include query string parameters causing the JSON response to change without
  the revision or the URI having changed.
* The bulk document update API has changed slightly on both the request and the
  response side. In addition, bulk updates are now atomic.
* CouchDB now uses `TCP_NODELAY` to fix performance problems with persistent
  connections on some platforms due to nagling.
* Including a `?descending=false` query string parameter in requests to views
  no longer raises an error.
* Requests to unknown top-level reserved URLs (anything with a leading
  underscore) now return a `unknown_private_path` error instead of the
  confusing `illegal_database_name`.
* The Temporary view handling now expects a JSON request body, where the JSON
  is an object with at least a `map` member, and optional `reduce` and
  `language` members.
* Temporary views no longer determine the view server based on the Content-Type
  header of the `POST` request, but rather by looking for a `language` member
  in the JSON body of the request.
* The status code of responses to `DELETE` requests is now 200 to reflect that
  that the deletion is performed synchronously.
